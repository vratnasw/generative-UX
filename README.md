# Ideas for using Generative AI along with causal inference for website design
* Use free generative models (NLP or image based) to create images and text for a website

* Automate the task of image and text generation by using generative AI agents via langchain

* Look at causal inference for the behavior of clients to different websites

* Integrate sentiment and emotional analysis into the causal inference

## Free generative LLM models
 *  OpenLLaMA
 *  Alpaca
 * Baize V2
 * CalderaAI
 * Lit-LLaMA Ô∏è

## Free stable diffusion models
 *  Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0
 * Stable-Diffusion-v1-5

One will need to find the suitable stable diffusion model that suits the needs of the client and the designer. What this amounts to is taking a stable diffusion model then fine tuning it with images from the designer. There is a substantial amount of models on HuggingFace that are free, many of which are fine-tuned already.
